            <h2>Introduction:</h2>
            <p>
                This website is for a project on extracting semantic information from Computer Science research papers.<br>
                It uses active learning, which means that the program will ask questions that puzzles it the most.<br>
                After more data is collected, the program will get better (hopefully) at labeling pairs of key phrases and at asking questions.
            </p>

            <h2>Instructions:</h2>
            <ul>
             <li>1: Input your username and hit submit</li>
             <li>2: A pair of key words/phrases should appear along with the context they're in.<br>
                 Please mark how the first word is related to the second one.<br>
                 Choose "Neither" if you don't think they are related. </li>
             <li>3: Hit the submit button to submit your response. Simply close the window when you don't wish to label more. </li>
             <li>4: If you're not sure, sometimes Googling the two phrase helps. Your judgement should be in general
                 sentence independent, so feel free to use outside sources to help you make the choice. Feel free to leave comments for the choice you've made.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Examples:</h2>
            <ul>
             <li>Sentence: “I was talking about machine_learners* and Dave said SVMs* are the best.”.<br>
                 Answer: SVMs is-a machine_learners.<br>
                 Reason: SVM is a type of machine learner. Please Ignore plural forms when you make your judgement.</li>
             <li>Sentence: “in section 2 we summarize the statistics required by collectors* such as metronome* to guarantee correct operation .”.<br>
                 Answer: Neither.<br>
                 Reason: metronome is a type of statistics, not a collector. Please analyze the sentence carefully.</li>
             <li>Sentence: “14th european signal_processing* conference* ( eusipco 2006 ) , florence , italy ”.<br>
                 Answer: Neither.<br>
                 Reason: signal_processing conference could be a phrase, but signal_processing is not a conference generally speaking.</li>
             <li>Sentence: “semi-structured data , notably xml* [ 7 ] , is just emerging as an alternative to both unstructured* and structured data . ”.<br>
                 Answer: Neither.<br>
                 Reason: if the key phrases are unstructured_data and xml, the answer would be different, but since "unstructured" is not a noun, the correct choice is "Neither".</li>

            </ul>
